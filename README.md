## About Piccolo AI<sup>™</sup>

Piccolo AI is the open-source version of [SensiML Analytics Studio](https://sensiml.com/services/toolkit/analytics-studio/), a software development toolkit for constructing sensor-based AI inference models optimzed to run on low-power microcontrollers and IoT edge platforms (ex. x86 embedded PCs, RPi, arm Cortex-A mobile processors).  Piccolo AI is intended for individual developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts and made available under the AGPLv3 license. For enterprise teams contact SensiML for a licensed enterprise version of the software.

The Piccolo AI project includes:

* **SensiML's ML Engine**: The engine behind SensiML’s AutoML model building, sensor data management, model tracking, and embedded firmware generation 
* **Embedded ML SDK**: SensiML's Inferencing and DSP SDK designed for building and running DSP & ML pipelines on edge devices
* **Analytic Studio UI**: An Intuitive web interface for working with the SensiML ML Engine to build TinyML applications
* **SensiML Python Client**: Allows programmatic access to the REST API services through Jupyter Notebooks

### Use Cases and Application Examples
Piccolo AI is currently optimized for the classification of **time-series** sensor data. Common use cases enabled by Piccolo AI include:

Piccolo AI is not limited to only the applications listed above.  Virtually any time-series sensor input(s) can be used to classify application-specific events of interest.  Piccolo AI also provides support for regression models as well as basic feature transform outputs without classification. To learn more about Piccolo AI features and capabilities, see the
[product page](https://sensiml.com/services/toolkit/analytics-studio/).

## Get Started

The simplest way to get started learning and using the features in Piccolo AI is to sign up for an account on SensiML's managed SaaS service at [SensiML Free Trial](https://sensiml.com/plans/trial/).

If you prefer to install and manage Piccolo AI yourself, you can get the latest version on [GitHub](https://github.com/sensiml/piccolo).

## Run Piccolo AI Locally

To try out Piccolo AI on your machine, we recommend using Docker.

### Prerequisites 

1. Install and start docker and docker-compose - https://docs.docker.com/engine/

   * *Note: Windows users will need to use the wsl2 backend. Follow the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)*
   * *Note: If using Docker Desktop go to **Preferences > Resources > Advanced** and set Memory to at least 12GB.*

2. Follow the [post-installation instructions](https://docker-docs.uclv.cu/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) as well to avoid having to run docker commands as sudo user 

3. Some functionality requires calling docker from within docker. To enable this, you will need to make the docker socket accessible to docker containers

   ```
   sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
   ```

5. By default the repository does not include docker images to generate model/compiler code for devices. You'll need to pull docker images for the compilers you want to use. See docker images:
  
   ```
   docker pull sensiml/sml_x86_generic:9.3.0-v1.0
   docker pull sensiml/sml_armgcc_generic:10.3.1-v1.0
   docker pull sensiml/sml_x86mingw_generic:9.3-v1.0
   docker pull sensiml/sensiml_tensorflow:0a4bec2a-v4.0
   ```
   
6. Make sure you have the latest sensiml base docker image version. If not, you can do a docker pull

   ```
   docker pull sensiml/base
   ```

### Start Piccolo AI

1. Make sure docker is running by checking your system tray icons. If it is not running then open Docker Desktop application in Windows to start the docker background service.

2. Open a Ubuntu terminal through Windows Subsystem for Linux

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sensiml/piccolo
   cd piccolo
   ```

3. Use [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to start the services

   ```
   docker compose up
   ```

**Login via the Web UI Interface**

Go to your browser at `http://localhost:8000` to log in to the UI. See the [Getting Started Guide](https://sensiml.com/documentation/guides/getting-started/overview.html) to get started. 

The default username and password is stored in the `src/server/datamanager/fixtures/default.yaml` file

   ```
   username: piccolo@sensiml.com
   password: TinyML4Life
   ```

## Data Studio

The Data Studio is SensiML's standalone Data Capture, Labeling, and Machine Learning Model testing application. It is a companion application to Piccolo AI, but it requires a [subscription](https://sensiml.com/plans/data-studio-edition/) to use with your local Piccolo AI. 


## Upgrades
Upgrades will need to check out the latest code and run database.intialize container script which will perform any migrations. You may also need to pull the newest sensiml/base docker image in some cases when the underlying packages have been changed.


## Documentation
