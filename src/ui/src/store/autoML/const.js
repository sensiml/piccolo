As the algorithm iterates each optimization step, it narrow downs the searching space to find a desired number of models. The optimization terminates when the desired model is found or the number of iterations reaches the max number of iterations. We take advantage of dynamic programming and optimizations for training algorithms to speed up the computation. This makes it possible to search large parameter spaces quickly and efficiently. The results are ranked by the fitness score which takes into account the model’s statistical and hardware parameters.`,
